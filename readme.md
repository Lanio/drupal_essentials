## setup.make
This is the file that I use to build my base Drupal websites off. This includes common modules that I use throughout various platforms that are created.

This can be built by using [Aegir](http://community.aegirproject.org/) or [Drush](http://drupal.org/project/drush) and requires [Drush Make](http://drupal.org/project/drush_make)
